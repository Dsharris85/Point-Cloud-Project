3D scene reconstruction system using the Kinect v1 written in Python for a class project

![alt text](https://github.com/Dsharris85/Point-Cloud-Project/blob/master/reconstruction_cover.png)

Register pairs of scanned RGB/Depth images into fragments to reconstruct scenes scanned in. Makes use of [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/), [OpenKinect's Python wrapper](https://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page), and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) in one application, allowing a streamlined usage of 3D modeling using the Kinect sensor.
  
**Features:**

**_- Scan images in from Kinect's video feed_**

**_- Register image fragments into fully reconstructed scene_**

**_- Point cloud file viewer_**

**_- Mesh model file viewer_**
