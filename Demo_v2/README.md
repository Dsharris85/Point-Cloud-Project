# Point-Cloud-Project Demo v2

Current demo visualizes either kinect depth data, or random points for use without kinect.

'S'to save to .pcd  
'SPACEBAR' to pause frame  
Mouse Drag to orbit  
Mouse Wheel to zoom  
Mouse Button3 + CTRL to pan camera around  

Included a requirements.txt and a dependencies.txt, though I wouldn't install from either directly as i let my environment get cluttered with other modules.
Use only as a reference if needed

You will have to create a directory 'PCD' in the same directory as main files to be able to save.
Once saved, you should be able to view .pcd files using viewer from Demo 1
